Inlining, Function Attributes
-----------------------------

o) Inlining functions
The compiler follows the C99 rules for inlining. See here for an explanation:

http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/tech/inline.html

To mark functions as inline functions you can do one of the following:

- If the function is only used within one module, mark it as 'static inline'. 
  The function will not be visible outside the module, like all static functions.

static inline void foo(int n) { 
    ...
}

- If the function should be used in several functions, define it 'inline' everywhere,
  and add one declaration with 'extern inline'.

extern inline void foo(int n);

inline void foo(int n) {
    ...
}

o) Prevent Inlining
To prevent the compiler from inlining, use the noinline attribute.

void foo(int n) __attribute__((noinline));
void foo(int n) {
    ...
}

o) Marking Functions as Used
To prevent the compiler from removing functions that have no call site in the bitcode
(either because they are entry functions or because the compiler generates the calls), 
add the 'used' attribute to the function declaration.

void _start(void) __attribute__((used));
void _start(void) {
    ...
}

Note that if the function is part of a module that is linked in from a bitcode archive,
the compiler will not link in the module if there is no usage of the function, even if it 
is marked as used. To force the linker to link in functions from archives, add a declaration 
for that function in any of your used modules, or link a bitcode module just containing declarations 
for those functions before linking with the library.



Target Triples and Target Identification
----------------------------------------

The Patmos tool-chain supports to following target triples:

    patmos-unknown-unknown-elf	    Do not use an OS, start with main()
    patmos-unknown-rtems	    Compile and link for RTEMS

The C frontend defines the following macros for Patmos targets

    __PATMOS__
    __patmos__

For RTEMS, the following macros are also defined:

    __rtems__

Use the following command to get a list of all defines for a target (do not omit -triple):

    patmos-clang -cc1 -triple patmos-unknown-unknown-elf -E -dM </dev/null

The default target triple for patmos-clang (without -cc1!) is 'patmos-unknown-unknown-elf',
if the program is called 'patmos-clang'. Otherwise, if the binary is called 
'<target>-clang', then '<target>' is used as default target triple.


Inline Assembler
----------------

Inline assembly syntax is similar to GCC inline assembly. It uses %0, %1, ... as placeholders for
operands. Accepted register constraints are: r or R for any general purpose register,
{$<registername>} to use a specific register, i for immediates, or the index of an output register to
assign an input register the same register as the output register.

-- Example --
    int i, j, k;
    asm("mov  $r31 = %1  # copy i into r31\n\t"
        "add  %0 = $r5, %2\n\t"
	"call %3\n\t"	     // call myfunction
	"nop ; nop \n\t"     // delay slots
        : "=r" (j)
        : "0" (i), "{$r10}" (k), "i" (&myfunction)
	: "$r5" );
-- End --

Please see backend.txt for a description of the Patmos assembler syntax.

You can mark functions as naked to prevent the generation of a prologue, epilogue or any spill code.
In such functions, effectively only inline assembly is allowed. Note that the compiler will still 
insert a return instruction.

void foo(int n) __attribute__((naked));
void foo(int n) {
    asm("nop");
}

Known Bugs: 

Clobbering the registers $r30/$r31 is not supported and calls inside inline assembler will not cause the
prologue to save $r30/$31.

Constraining an output to a register ("={$r10}") does not work, for some reason LLVM looses the output
register operand somewhere between SelectionDAGBuilder::visitInlineAsm() and AsmPrinter::EmitInlineAsm().


Scratchpad Memory
-----------------

Use the following header to get the relevant functions and macros:

#include <machine/spm.h>

The _SPM macro must be used for all pointers that point into the SPM.

_SPM unsigned int *spm_data = (_SPM unsigned int*) 0x1234;

You can use the spm_copy_from_ext and spm_copy_to_ext functions
to copy data from global memory to SPM and back. Use spm_wait() to
wait for the copy transaction to complete.
