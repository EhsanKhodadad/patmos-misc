Various options
===============

TODO: merge this with usage.tex, make all of this a .tex file (or a .txt/.rst file?)

o) Keep relocation infos in executable for objdump (does not work with patmos-clang -g !)

patmos-clang -Xgold -q -o <binary> ....
patmos-llvm-objdump -r -d <binary> | less


Debugging
=========

Some useful commands for debugging:

# print out executed instructions and the values of their operands 
# starting from some cycle 
pasim -q --debug=<cycle-to-start-printing> --debug-fmt=instr <binary>

# show disassembly of binary
patmos-llvm-objdump -r -d <binary> | less

# compile with debug infos, show source line numbers
patmos-clang -g -o <binary> ...
readelf --debug-dump=decodedline <binary>

Note that the PC usually comes from the Fetch stage in the simulator, i.e., 
it is a few cycles ahead of the actual output.
