==============================

o) Compiling patmos-gold with GCC 4.7.0 aborts with an error about narrowing conversion

Workaround: use CXXFLAGS=-Wno-narrowing for configure, upgrade to a newer GCC version or 
use clang to compile the toolchain. 

If you are using the build.sh script, set GOLD_CXXFLAGS="-Wno-narrowing" in build.cfg.
